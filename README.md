**EQUITY IN HEALTHCARE**

*Background:*

Healthcare is a significant contributor to the  economy, accounting for approximately 17% of GDP. However , healthcare inequity has become a global issue. Addressing this challenge has an extensive positive impact on womenâ€™s health, which is key for societies and economies to thrive. This datathon is designed to help you discover whether disparate treatments exist and to understand the drivers of those biases, such as demographic and societal factors.

*Challenge task:* 

You will be asked to predict if the patients received metastatic cancer diagnosis within 90 days of screening.

*Metastatic cancer:*

Also known as metastasis, is a term used to describe cancer that has spread from its original (primary) site to other parts of the body. Cancer cells can break away from the primary tumor, enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system, and travel to distant organs or tissues, where they can form new tumors.
Metastatic breast cancer originates in the breast tissue, even though it may spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, bones, or brain.
Metastatic cancer is typically classified as Stage IV, indicating that the cancer has spread beyond the primary site to distant organs or tissues.

Metastatic cancer is generally considered incurable, but treatment aims to control the disease, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life. Treatment options may include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery (in some cases), and supportive care.
Symptoms of metastatic cancer depend on the location of the metastases. Common symptoms may include pain, fatigue, weight loss, difficulty breathing, neurological symptoms (such as headaches or seizures), and others related to specific organ involvement.

*Why is this important?*

Metastatic TNBC is considered the most aggressive TNBC and requires most urgent and timely treatment. Unnecessary delays in diagnosis and subsequent treatment can have devastating effects in these difficult cancers. Differences in the wait time to get treatment is a good proxy for disparities in healthcare access.

The primary goal of building these models is to detect relationships between demographics of the patient with the likelihood of getting timely treatment. The secondary goal is to see if environmental hazards impact proper diagnosis and treatment.
